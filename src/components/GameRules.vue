    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <h3>X01</h3>
    <p>
      You start with either 301, 501 or 701 points. What you throw is subtracted
      from your total, with the inner ring counting triple and the outer ring
      counting double. The goal is to get to exactly 0 before your opponents. If
      you go below 0, your score is reset to what it was at the start of your
      turn. If finish is chosen as double or triple, you must hit a double or
      triple as your last dart.
    </p>
    <h3>Round the Clock</h3>
    <p>
      The goal of this game mode is to hit all the numbers between 1 and 20.
      Unless random is selected, you start on 1, then 2, and so on. If double or
      triple is selected, only the double or triple ring is valid. If fast is
      enabled, a double will count as 2 points and triple as 3.
    </p>
    <h3>Killer</h3>
    <p>
      First all players choose their segments. This is usually done by throwing
      one dart with your non-dominant hand. Once all players have selected their
      segment, the game begins. The objective is to hit your segment 5 times.
      The outer ring counts as 2 and the inner ring counts as 3. If you get more
      than 5 points, you automatically lose. Once you have 5 points, you can
      throw at the other players' segments, decreasing their score the same way.
    </p>
    <h3>Skovhugger</h3>
    <p>
      This game consists of 12 rounds. The current round is shown in the upper
      right corner. Most of the rounds, you aim for one specific segment,
      getting points for each dart you hit. If you hit no darts, your score is
      halved. There is also a double-round and a triple-round, where you can hit
      any segment in the outer or inner ring, respectively. During the 41-round,
      your aim is to hit 41 points exactly. You don't need to use all 3 of your
      darts. The last round is on the bullseye.
    </p>
    <h3>Cricket</h3>
    <p>
      The goal of this game mode is to hit the numbers 15-20 and the bullseye 3
      times each. The outer ring counts as 2 and the inner ring counts as 3.
      Once a number is hit 3 times, you open it. After a segment is opened, you
      can score points on it. If all players open a segment, it gets closed, and
      you can no longer score on it. The game ends when a player has all
      segments open or closed, and has the most points.
